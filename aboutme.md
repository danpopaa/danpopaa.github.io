My name is **Dan Popa** and I'm currently working in finance as a **Financial Controller**. 

Over the years I worked for multinational companies and small startups, where I covered multiple finance areas, such as: 
- **accounting** (Balance Sheet & Income statement - full ownership, Financial statements preparation, AP, AR, Fixed assests, Inventories, Cash, Payroll, etc)
- **management & financial reporting** (forecast, budgeting, KPIs, identifying & explaining business drivers).

Currently I'm learning **Python** as I'm looking to automate specific daily/monthly tasks.

Do you have any feedback to share with me, please feel free to contact me:
